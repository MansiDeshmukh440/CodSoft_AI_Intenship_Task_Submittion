## CodSoft_AI_Intenship_Task_Submittion

#Internship Tasks:-

This repository contains the projects developed during my internship. Each task focuses on a different aspect of artificial intelligence and machine learning, providing a comprehensive learning experience.



TASK 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses

Description:-
In this task, I built a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. By using if-else statements or pattern matching techniques, the chatbot identifies user queries and provides appropriate responses. This task helped me gain a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.


Key Learnings:-
Basic natural language processing (NLP),
Rule-based response generation,
Conversation flow design.



TASK 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI

Description:-
I implemented an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, optionally with Alpha-Beta Pruning, to ensure it is unbeatable. This project introduced me to game theory and basic search algorithms.


Key Learnings:-
Game theory principles,
Minimax algorithm,
Alpha-Beta Pruning,
Basic search algorithms,



TASK 3: Image Captioning

Description:-
This task involved combining computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI. I used pre-trained image recognition models like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images and then employed a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.


Key Learnings:-
Computer vision techniques,
Feature extraction with pre-trained models (VGG, ResNet),
Sequence generation with RNNs and transformers,
Image captioning.



TASK 4: Recommendation System

Description:-
I created a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. The system employs techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend movies, books, or products. This task provided insights into building recommendation engines and understanding user preferences.


Key Learnings:-
Recommendation system techniques,
Collaborative filtering,
Content-based filtering,
User preference analysis.



TASK 5: Face Detection and Recognition

Description:-
In this task, I developed an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. I utilized pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades and deep learning-based face detectors. Additionally, I added face recognition capabilities using techniques such as Siamese networks or ArcFace.


Key Learnings:-
Face detection methods (Haar cascades, deep learning-based detectors),
Face recognition techniques (Siamese networks, ArcFace),
Real-time image processing,
Computer vision applications.
